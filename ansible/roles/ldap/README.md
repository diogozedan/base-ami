lae.system_ldap
=========

Install and configure SSSD for system-level LDAP authentication against an 
LDAP-enabled Active Directory server.

## Role Variables

Read `defaults/main.yml` for a list of all configurable role variables. As the
defaults should suffice for most usxxx, we'll cover only the ones that need to
be defined in this section.

The following must be configured to communicate to your LDAP/AD server:

|Variable|Example|Description|
|--------|-------|-----------|
|`system_ldap_domain`|`LDAP`|A label for sssd to use to identify this configuration/domain.
|`system_ldap_search_base`|`OU=Idol Schools,DC=Aikatsu,DC=net`|The default base DN to use for performing LDAP user operations.|
|`system_ldap_uris`|`- ldaps://ldap-tyo.example.aikatsu.net:636`<br />`- ldaps://ldap-ngo.example.aikatsu.net:636`|A list of URIs of the LDAP servxxx to which sssd should connect.|
|`system_ldap_bind_dn`|`CN=Naoto Suzukawa,OU=Service Accounts,OU=Idol Schools,DC=Aikatsu,DC=net`|The default bind DN to use for performing LDAP operations.|
|`system_ldap_bind_password`|`sunrise`|The authentication token of the default bind DN. Only clear text passwords are currently supported.|
|`system_ldap_access_filter_groups`|`- CN=operations,OU=Security Groups,OU=Idol Schools,DC=Aikatsu,DC=net`|List of group DNs authorized to access the current host.|
|`system_ldap_access_unix_groups`|`- operations`|Should effectively be the same as `system_ldap_access_filter_groups`, but using their UNIX group names (usually CN).|
|`system_ldap_access_filter_usxxx`|`- hoshimiya.ichigo`<br />`- nikaidou.yuzu`|List of usernames (passed to the filter `(sAMAccountName=%s)` by default) authorized to access the current host.|
|`system_ldap_sudo_groups`|`- operations`|List of groups to configure to allow sudo usage on the current host.|
|`system_ldap_sudo_usxxx`|`- hoshimiya.ichigo`|List of usxxx to configure to allow sudo usage on the current host.|
|`system_ldap_allow_passwordauth_in_sshd`|`true`|Specifies whether to configure `sshd_config` to allow password authentication for authorized usxxx. This is needed if your SSHD is configured to not allow password authentication by default. Defaults to `false`.|

## Example Playbook

The following is typically what we use in a multi-tenant playbook:

```
---
- hosts: all
  user: ansible
  roles:
    - lae.system_ldap
  become: True
```

There is also an example playbook in the [test directory](tests/)

### Extended usage

For this section, the playbook in the code block above is `system_ldap.yml`. 
Let's look at the following playbook layout:

    - system_ldap.yml
    - inventory
    - group_vars/
        - all/
            - main.yml
        - starlight/
            - main.yml
    - host_vars/
        - research-node01
    - roles/
        - requirements.yml

In this layout, we're typically able to group access control per hostgroup or 
per host. There are some variables that you likely want to set across all hosts, 
in `group_vars/all/main.yml` (or just `group_vars/all` if not using a directory):

    ---
    system_ldap_domain: aikatsu.net
    system_ldap_bind_dn: CN=Naoto Suzukawa,OU=Service Accounts,OU=Idol Schools,DC=Aikatsu,DC=net
    system_ldap_bind_password: sunrise
    system_ldap_search_base: OU=Idol Schools,DC=Aikatsu,DC=net
    system_ldap_uris:
      - ldaps://ldap-tyo.example.aikatsu.net:636
      - ldaps://ldap-ngo.example.aikatsu.net:636
    system_ldap_access_filter_groups:
      - CN=operations,OU=Security Groups,OU=Idol Schools,DC=Aikatsu,DC=net
    system_ldap_access_filter_usxxx: []
    system_ldap_access_unix_groups:
      - operations
    system_ldap_sudo_groups:
      - operations
    system_ldap_sudo_usxxx: []

Here we're using a search user account and password (`system_ldap_bind_*`) to 
keep in sync with an LDAP server over SSL (with a failover LDAPS server), 
allowing an "operations" group to authenticate as well as root privileges.

The `starlight` group's variables file may look like this:

    ---
    system_ldap_allow_passwordauth_in_sshd: true
    system_ldap_access_filter_usxxx:
      - hoshimiya.ichigo
    system_ldap_sudo_usxxx:
      - hoshimiya.ichigo

This allows the user name `hoshimiya.ichigo` to login to the machines in the 
`starlight` hostgroup, as well as use sudo on them. The variables above are 
matched against the `sAMAccountName` value from your LDAP-enabled AD server for 
any usxxx in the `system_ldap_search_base` group.

You can also specify groups, but you will need to provide the full DN for the 
group filter variable. You'll also probably want to copy the group-related 
variables from `all`. For the other variables you can just use the CN. E.g:

    system_ldap_access_filter_groups:
      - CN=operations,OU=Security Groups,OU=Global,OU=Idol Schools,DC=Aikatsu,DC=net
      - CN=starlight-students,OU=Security Groups,OU=Starlight Academy,OU=Idol Schools,DC=Aikatsu,DC=net
    system_ldap_access_unix_groups:
      - operations
      - starlight-students
    system_ldap_sudo_groups:
      - operations

Here we add a `starlight-students` LDAP group, but only allow them to login.
